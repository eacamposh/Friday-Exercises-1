 * Still Using Variables:
 * Write a program that stores your name and year of graduation into variables, and displays their values on the screen.
 * Make sure that you use two variables, and that the variable that holds your name is the best type for such a variable,
 * and that the variable that holds the year is the best type for that variable.
 * Also make sure that your variable names are good: the name of a variable should always relate to its contents.
 *
 * Example: "My name is Juan Valdez, and I'll graduate in 2010"
